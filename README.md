## 🧮 Financial Calculation Logic

The calculation logic is located in:

```txt
backend/src/services/calculationService.js
```

The system uses the following rules:

```txt
Estimated Bank Net = Gross Salary × 0.68

Fixed Costs = Bank Net × 0.55
Savings Goals = Bank Net × 0.10
Active Investments = Bank Net × 0.10
Guilt-Free Spending = Bank Net × 0.275

Investment Projection = Investment × (1 + 0.07)^year
```

The investment projection is calculated for 15 years.

---

## 🗄️ Database Structure

The database contains two main tables.

### `financial_profiles`

Stores the user's financial profile.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `id` | Unique profile ID |
| `name` | User name |
| `grossSalary` | Gross monthly salary |
| `bankNet` | Net income received in the bank |
| `createdAt` | Profile creation date |
| `updatedAt` | Last update date |

### `spending_plans`

Stores the calculated spending plan for each profile.

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| `id` | Unique spending plan ID |
| `profileId` | Related financial profile ID |

---

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

The backend uses environment variables from a `.env` file.

Example for local development:

```env
PORT=5050
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5433/intelligent_investor_db?schema=public"
```

Example for running backend tests against the Docker Hub database:

```env
PORT=5050
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5435/intelligent_investor_prod_db?schema=public"
```

Important:

```txt
backend/.env should not be uploaded to GitHub.
```

Use `.env.example` as a safe example file.

---

## 🐳 Docker Explanation

Docker is used to run the project in isolated containers.

Instead of installing and running every part manually, Docker allows the whole system to run in a clean and consistent environment.

### Image vs Container

```txt
Image = a template/package used to create a container
Container = a running instance of an image
```

Simple example:

```txt
Image is like a recipe.
Container is like the meal created from that recipe.
```

### Containers in This Project

| Container | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 🎨 Frontend container | Runs the React frontend through Nginx. |
| 🚀 Backend container | Runs the Node.js and Express API. |
| 🐘 Database container | Runs PostgreSQL and stores the data. |

### Docker Images Used

| Image | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `yeuda4222/intelligent-investor-frontend:latest` | Frontend image |
| `yeuda4222/intelligent-investor-backend:latest` | Backend image |
| `yeuda4222/intelligent-investor-db:latest` | Database image |
| `postgres:16` | Official PostgreSQL image |

### Dockerfile

A Dockerfile contains the instructions for building a Docker image.

This project includes:

```txt
backend/Dockerfile
frontend/Dockerfile
database/Dockerfile
```

### Docker Compose

Docker Compose is used to run multiple services together.

Instead of running frontend, backend, and database manually, Docker Compose starts everything with one command.

Example:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.hub.yml up -d
```

---

## 🧠 Why Docker Is Useful

Docker helps solve several problems:

- It makes the project easier to run on another computer.
- It prevents issues caused by different local environments.
- It keeps frontend, backend, and database isolated.
- It allows the full system to run with one command.
- It makes the project closer to a real production setup.
- It allows sharing ready images through Docker Hub.

---

## 🔌 Port Mapping

The frontend, backend, and database run on different ports because they are separate services.

| Service | Internal Container Port | External Local Port | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| Frontend | `80` | `8090` | Opens the website in the browser |
| Backend | `5050` | `5052` | Exposes the API |
| Database | `5432` | `5435` | Exposes PostgreSQL locally |

Example:

```txt
localhost:8090  → frontend container port 80
localhost:5052  → backend container port 5050
localhost:5435  → postgres container port 5432
```

Inside Docker Compose, the backend connects to the database using the service name:

```txt
postgres:5432
```

From the local computer, tests connect to the database using:

```txt
localhost:5435
```

---

## 🚦 Environments

The project includes multiple environments.

| Environment | Frontend | Backend | Database | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Local | `http://localhost:5173` | `http://localhost:5050` | `localhost:5433` | Development |
| Staging | `http://localhost:8080` | `http://localhost:5051` | `localhost:5434` | Testing before production |
| Production-like | `http://localhost:8090` | `http://localhost:5052` | `localhost:5435` | Production-like run |
| Docker Hub | `http://localhost:8090` | `http://localhost:5052` | `localhost:5435` | Run from Docker Hub images |

This separation helps test the system safely without mixing data between environments.

---

## ☁️ Docker Hub

The project images were uploaded to Docker Hub.

Docker Hub repositories:

```txt
yeuda4222/intelligent-investor-frontend
yeuda4222/intelligent-investor-backend
yeuda4222/intelligent-investor-db
```

The Docker Hub environment allows another team member to run the full project without building the images locally.

---

## ☁️ Running the Project From Docker Hub

From the root project folder:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/intelligent-investor-platform
```

Stop previous containers:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.hub.yml down
```

Pull the latest images from Docker Hub:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.hub.yml pull
```

Start the full system:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.hub.yml up -d
```

Check running containers:

```bash
docker ps
```

Expected containers:

```txt
intelligent_investor_hub_frontend
intelligent_investor_hub_backend
intelligent_investor_hub_postgres
```

Open the frontend:

```txt
http://localhost:8090
```

Check backend health:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5052/health
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "status": "OK",
  "service": "Intelligent Investor Backend",
  "database": "Connected"
}
```

Check profiles API:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5052/api/profiles
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "message": "Financial profiles loaded successfully",
  "data": []
}
```

Stop the Docker Hub environment:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.hub.yml down
```

---

## 🐳 Docker Hub Database Image

The project includes a custom database image:

```txt
yeuda4222/intelligent-investor-db:latest
```

This image is based on PostgreSQL and includes the database initialization file.

This is useful because:

- The database schema can be shared through Docker Hub.
- Team members do not need to manually create tables.
- The full project can run from Docker Hub images.
- The database structure is consistent between team members.

In the Docker Hub environment, the database schema is already initialized by the database image.

Because of that, the backend starts directly with:

```bash
node src/server.js
```

---

## 🏷️ Environment Badge

The frontend displays an environment badge.

Examples:

```txt
Environment: Local
Environment: Staging
Environment: Production
```

The badge helps identify which environment is currently running.

This is controlled by:

```txt
VITE_APP_ENV
```

This is useful in DevOps because it helps avoid confusion between environments.

---

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes several types of automated tests.

---

## 🔁 GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline

GitHub Actions is used to run an automatic CI pipeline.

The workflow file is located at:

```txt
.github/workflows/ci.yml
```

The pipeline runs automatically when code is pushed to the `main` branch or when a pull request is opened.

### What the CI Pipeline Does

| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| 📥 Checkout repository | Downloads the code into the GitHub runner. |
| 🟩 Setup Node.js | Installs the required Node.js version. |
| 📦 Install backend dependencies | Runs backend dependency installation. |
| 📦 Install frontend dependencies | Runs frontend dependency installation. |
| 🐳 Docker build check | Verifies that Docker images can be built. |
| 🐘 Start PostgreSQL | Starts the database service for tests. |
| 🔺 Prisma generate | Generates Prisma Client. |
| 🗄️ Prisma migrate | Applies database migrations. |
| ✅ Backend tests | Runs Jest backend tests. |
| 🧪 Frontend tests | Runs Vitest frontend tests. |
| 🌐 Cypress tests | Runs Cypress E2E and edge case tests. |
| 🧹 Cleanup | Stops containers after the run. |

### Why GitHub Actions Is Useful

GitHub Actions helps the project by:

- Running tests automatically.
- Finding problems before merging code.
- Making sure backend, frontend, and Cypress tests pass.
- Checking that Docker builds are valid.
- Giving a clear green or red status for every push.

A green workflow means the project passed the automated checks.

Prisma Studio usually opens at:

```txt
http://localhost:5555
```

When using the Docker Hub database, make sure the backend `.env` points to:

```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5435/intelligent_investor_prod_db?schema=public"
```
